    "The final project for the class will need to draw from everything you have covered in class, at least everything relevant for your final project. For that you will need to choose a topic. You will be using **the image and text** datasets that we have seen on our sessions. \n",
    "\n",
    "It doesn't need to be a super revolutionary idea, but at least have in mind the issue of reducing the time between information and action. And you will need to send it to me. \n",

    "The project will need to contain the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ingesting, exploring and cleaning data for your project\n",
    "2. Choosing/testing of algorithm approach\n",
    "3. Visualizing the results\n",
    "4. Packaging the project into a product\n",
